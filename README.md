# pipeline-structural-variation

### Overview

`pipeline-structural-variation` is a pipeline for calling structural variations on whole genome sequencing data obtained from Oxford Nanopore sequencing platforms. It accepts FASTQ files and outputs aligned reads and filtered SV calls.

### Features

The pipeline performs the following steps:
- Maps reads using lra
- Produces QC report using NanoPlot [optional]
- Estimates appropriate parameters for variant calling depending on read depth
- Calls variants using cuteSV
- Filters variants by minimum/maximum length, read support, or type (e.g. insertion, deletion, etc.)

******************
# Getting Started

### Requirements
The following software packages must be installed prior to running:

-  [miniconda3](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - please refer to installation [instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

### Installation
After installing miniconda3 (see above), install the pipeline as follows:
```bash
# Get pipeline
$ wget -O pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-structural-variation/archive/v2.0.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf pipeline-structural-variation.tar.gz
# Change to directory
$ cd pipeline-structural-variation*
# Create conda environment with all dependencies
$ conda env create -n pipeline-structural-variation-v2 -f env.yml
# Activate environment
$ conda activate pipeline-structural-variation-v2
# To test if the installation was successful run
$ snakemake -p -j 1 --configfile config.yml
# Deactivate environment
$ conda deactivate
```

### Input

To run the pipeline the following input files are required:

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Reference genome | FASTA file containing the reference genome (e.g. GRCh38 for human) |
| Nanopore reads| Folder containing FASTQ files or a single concatenated FASTQ file. Reads should be **q-score filtered** (see FAQ)|

### Output

 The main output files created by the pipeline are:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Aligned reads | Aligned reads in indexed and sorted BAM format |
| Variant calls | Called variants in VCF format |

After the pipeline has finished you can find the aligned reads in `{sample_name}/alignment/` and the indexed and zipped VCF file in `{sample_name}/sv_calls/{sample_name}_cutesv_filtered.vcf.gz`, where `{sample_name}` is derived from the snakemake configuration (see below).

### Usage:

To run the pipeline with default settings invoke snakemake as follows.

```bash
$ snakemake all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa threads=30
```

`all` is the default target (see Targets); this will run all steps required for SV calling and produce a QC report for the input reads using NanoPlot. `input_fastq` specifies the input FASTQ files or a folder containing multiple input FASTQ files (e.g. the pass folder from MinKNOW).

### Targets

|Name| Description |
|--|--|
| qc | Only maps reads and produces a QC report |
| call | Maps reads and calls variants but does not produce a QC report |
| eval | Evaluates the called variants against the GIAB truth set **only** applicable when sequencing [HG002](https://www.coriell.org/0/Sections/Search/Sample_Detail.aspx?Ref=NA24385&Product=DNA) |

### Options

The pipeline accepts several input parameters. They can either be changed in the `config.yml` (see below) file or specified when running snakemake.

For example:
```bash
snakemake eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa min_sv_length=100 threads=30
```
In the above example the minimum SV length parameter was changed to 100 bp.

##### Required parameters

These parameters have to be specified to run the pipeline.

| Parameter | Allowed | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| input_fastq | Absolute file path | FASTQ file or folder containing FASTQ files |
| reference_fasta | Absolute file path | FASTA file containing the reference genome |

##### Optional parameters

| Parameter | Allowed | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| sample_name | string without spaces | my_sample | Name of the sample |
| min_sv_length | Integer > 30 | 30 | Minimum SV length |
| max_sv_length | Integer | 100000 | Maximum SV length |
| min_read_length | Integer | 1000 | Min read length. Shorter reads will be ignored |
| min_read_mapping_quality | Integer | 20 | Min mapping quality. Reads with lower mapping quality will be discarded |
| min_read_support | Integer | 'auto' | Minimum read support required to call a SV (auto for auto-detect) |

# Annotating and visualising the results

## Annotate

This step will become part of the pipeline in the future. Currently, use tools like `bedtools` or `vcfanno` to annotate the VCF file with information about genes, repeats, known SV etc. from GTF/GFF/BED files.

There are many ways to retrieve annotations. A few examples are:

-  [UCSC genome browser](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables)
-  [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)
-  [GENCODE](https://www.gencodegenes.org/)

# Results

We benchmarked the pipeline against the preliminary [Genome in a bottle](https://jimb.stanford.edu/giab) SV truth set for HG002.

### Precision and Recall
The pipeline was run using `auto` for determining the most suitable cuteSV parameters to get a good balance between precision and recall. Depending on your application you might want to change the `min_read_support` parameter to maximize either precision or recall.

| Dataset | Pipeline | Min. read support | Coverage | Precision | Recall | Precision gt | Recall gt |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------
| HG002 q7 filtered | v2.0.0 | auto | 60* | 0.955 | 0.979 | 0.945 | 0.979 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v2.0.0 | auto | 45* | 0.956 | 0.977 | 0.942 | 0.977 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v2.0.0 | auto | 30* | 0.953 | 0.971 | 0.934 | 0.970 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v2.0.0 | auto | 20* | 0.954 | 0.959 | 0.923 | 0.957 |
| HG002 q7 filtered | v2.0.0 | auto | 15* | 0.952 | 0.938 | 0.904 | 0.935 |

\* Coverage was computed using mosdepth from the BAM file. The BAM file was neither filtered by mapping quality nor read length.


### Reproducing the results
Run the pipeline with HG002 data using the `eval` target. In the output folder you will find `eval/summary.txt` containing precision and recall values.

### FAQs

**I only want my results! What should I do?**
Install pipeline (see Installation) and run as follows.
```bash
$ snakemake all --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa threads=16
```
You will find your results in the following locations:

**Aligned reads:**

```sv_sample01/alignment/my_sample_lra.bam```

**Variant calls:**

```sv_sample01/sv_calls/my_sample_cutesv_filtered.vcf.gz```

**What kind of structural variants are supported?**

Currently the pipeline has been validated to detect insertions, deletions and duplications (currently reported as insertions as in the GIAB truthset) from whole genome sequencing data. Support for inversions and translocations will be added in the future.

**What is the minimum SV length supported?**

Currently, 30 bp.

**How can i filter my reads by q-score?**

The most recent version of MinKNOW will perform filtering automatically. When using the FASTQ files from the `pass` output folder no additional filtering is required. For unfiltered datasets use [NanoFilt](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanofilt) with a minimum q-score of 6.

**How long will it take to run the pipeline for a 30X human dataset?**

When running with 30 CPU cores this will take roughly 3-4 hours.

**How much memory will I need?**

Memory consumption is determined by lra. Therefore, 16 GB will be required for human datasets. For smaller genomes 8 GB will be sufficient.

**How much storage will I need?**

Unzipped FASTQ files for a human 30X human dataset will require roughly 200 GB. In addition 150 GB will be required for the mapped BAM files.  

**Are FAST5 files required to run the pipeline?**

No.

**Can I use the pipeline to detect variants in a cancer dataset or to detect somatic variants?**

The pipeline has not yet been validated on cancer samples or for somatic variant detection.

**Can I use the pipeline to detect SVs for targeted sequencing experiments (e.g. long amplicons, etc.)?**

Calling variants in targeted regions is supported but requires the user to specify a BED file containing the coordinates of the targeted regions.

For example, save the following in a file called `targets.bed`

```
chr1 6579767 6589767
```

and run pipeline as follows:

```bash
snakemake eval --config input_fastq=/data/pass/ reference_fasta=/data/ref/hg38.fa target_bed=targets.bed threads=30
```
Make sure that the chromosome names in the BED file match the names in your reference FASTA files (e.g. chr1 vs. 1).

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusions using DNA data?**

The current version does not support calling gene fusions from DNA data as translocation calling is not supported yet. However, support for translocations will be available in the future.

**Can I use this pipeline to detect gene fusion using cDNA data?**

cDNA data is not supported.
